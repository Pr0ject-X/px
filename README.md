## Project-X (Next Generation)

Project-X was created as a plugable CLI development tool that can be used to streamline redundant tasks for a given project. Due to this type of architecture there are only a few commands that are provided by the core application; so it so that it remains as lean as possible.

Most commands will be loaded from a third-party plugins which will need to be required per project.

Please visit [https://pr0ject-x.github.io/px/](https://pr0ject-x.github.io/px/) for more documentation on how to use project-x.
