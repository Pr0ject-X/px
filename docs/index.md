Project-X was developed as a plugable CLI utility which can streamline redundant tasks for a variety of projects. This includes local or remote setup, CI integration along with artifact builds and deployments, and much more. The core foundation of Project-X was built using the [Robo](https://robo.li/) framework, which provided a solid foundation.

With a plugable architecture in place we heavily rely on third-party plugins provided by the community to build most of the integrations that we use in our daily routines. There are a limited amount of features provided in the core utility. Which allows the project to remain as slim as possible, so it scales based solely on the projects requirements.

## Community

It's really easy to get involved in the Project-X community. Developing third-party integrations can be as easy as adding a 100 lines of code in a plugin, which can be shared with other developers in the community so that we all can become more proficient in our daily routines. Please head over to the [Extending Section]() if you would like to get more involved with developing.
